            <h3> What is UC Ship? </h3>
            <p>
              UC SHIP offers medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, and mental health and substance use
              disorder benefits for UC undergraduate and graduate students and their eligible
              dependents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because all UC students are required to have medical insurance, UC automatically
              enrolls registered students at the Davis, Hastings College of the Law, Irvine, Los
              Angeles, Merced, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, San Diego and San Francisco
              campuses in UC SHIP each academic year.
            </p>

            <h3> Signing Up </h3>
            <p>
              UC SHIP automatically covers all registered undergraduate and graduate students,
              including domestic and international students, and students in absentia. However, you
              may waive your health insurance if you already have a health plan
            </p>

            <h3> Student Health Center </h3>
            <p>
              The student health center (SHC) is an outpatient health center providing on-campus
              medical, preventive care, and mental health and substance use disorder services. Some
              SHCs also offer a full-service pharmacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SHC is staffed by board-certified physicians, certified nurse practitioners, and
              physician assistants, all of whom are experts in meeting student health care needs.
              When you are covered by UC SHIP, SHC staff provide your primary care and coordinate
              any additional care you might need.
            </p>

            <h3> Eligible dependents of an enrolled UC SHIP student include: </h3>
