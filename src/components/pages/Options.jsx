            As many students start to become independent, they are often left confused about their
            options. In California, you may choose to either have health insurance or go without. If
            you plan on being insured, here are your options.
          </p>
          <h2>Parent or Guardian</h2>
          <p>
            Most people can stay on the healthcare plan of their parent or guardian, usually up
            until the age of 26. This is appealing to a lot of people since it is often cheaper.
            However, it also means that they must be reliant on their parent or guardian.
          </p>
          <h2>Employer</h2>
          <p>
            Most employers provide affordable healthcare options for their employees. The cost of
            premiums are usually shared between the employer and employee. In addition to healthcare
            insurance, employers often also provide other benefits such as retirement plans and
            dental care.
          </p>
          <h2>Spouse</h2>
          <p>
            If you are married to a person that has a health insurance plan through their employer,
            then you are eligible to join the same plan. If you and your spouse both work and are
            offered coverage from both your employers, then you may choose one plan from the
            employer that works best for you, or has the best coverage for the best price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option if you and your spouse both work is dual coverage. You can both sign up
            for coverage under your respective employers and cover the both of you with the two
            plans. Although it may be more expensive, some people prefer this, as it provides more
            coverage.
          </p>
          <h2>Government Programs</h2>
          <p>
            There are government programs available to those who cannot access healthcare through an
            employer or other means. If you live in California, Covered California can connect you
            to an affordable healthcare plan that works for you. Some plans offer low monthly
            premiums, but high deductibles, which work best if you rarely visit the doctor but would
            like to be covered in case you need it. Conversely, other plans offer higher coverage
            with low or no deductibles, but expect higher premiums.
